20716052,Road Maintenance(Engg),Potholes,45:00.0,Varthur,ReOpen,"Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to bring to your attention the premature and unsatisfactory closure of a road maintenance grievance submitted under the ID 20716052, dated 19-Apr-25, concerning severe potholes on the street at 1st Cross, Prakash Layout, Near Malibu Rosita Varthur, Bengaluru.

Despite highlighting the persistent and worsening issue with potholes that formed after incomplete restoration of the sewer line work two years ago, the complaint has been marked as ""Cleared"" without any visible action or communication from the assigned staff. There has been no repair or maintenance work carried out on the road post-complaint, and the condition remains hazardous for residents and commuters, especially with the onset of the rainy season.

Attached images were also submitted for reference, but the closure of the grievance without inspection or proper documentation of work done is highly disappointing. As citizens, we expect transparency and accountability in civic operations.

We kindly request the following:

Reopening of Grievance ID 20716052 for proper review.

On-site inspection by the engineering department.

A detailed update or acknowledgment from the assigned officer regarding the proposed action plan.

Actual repair work of the potholes and a permanent restoration of the affected stretch.

We hope that this serious issue will be addressed urgently, and the grievance will be handled in the interest of public safety and proper civic responsibility.",Yadu Krishna/AEE,,,,,,,Mahadevapura,3.47656528,7.925850015,10.72064015,22.12305544,0.331181593
